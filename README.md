## Data loading and analysis framework for Planetocosmics ASCII output

This framework is intended to be used interactively in the Ipython shell, although it is possible to use on systems that lack matplotlib as well. For the latter case, plotting functions will simply not be available.

There are (at least) two branches available in this repository: 
- `master` should be stable for any intended use
- `develop` contains newly implemented features and fixes and may not work in all cases, but should be mostly stable

Documentation is available in the docstrings of each class and function.
